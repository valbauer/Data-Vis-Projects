      <h1>Newly energized voters in 2016 New York City</h1>
        <h2>Did the 2016 Presidential election inspire long-time residents of New York City to vote?</h2>
      <h3 class="distributionDesc">   
        Each dot in this chart represents one voter in New York City that was registered to vote prior to the 2008 
        presidential election. However, these voters did not participate in a presidential election until 2016. They
        make up about 4% of the voting population in this dataset.
      </br>  
    </br>Blue dots are voters registered as Democrat (63% of the new voters).
  </br>
    </br>
      Red dots are voters registered as Republican (15% of the new voters).
    </br>
   
  </br>Purple dots are voters registered as any other party (22% of the new voters).
</br>
      </br>The median age of voters within the selected groups is indicated by the dark line.

        The voters depicted in this map are those who were registered prior to the 2008 presidential election 
        but did not vote until the 2016 presidential election. Their location has been geocoded to current election districts, 
        not 2016 vintage districts. Some of the election districts have been redrawn since 2016 
        and the election results for the new districts are not available.

        <p>The voter records in this visualization come from two citywide voter history files, one from 2013 and one from 2018.
          New York voters are assigned a unique identifier at the time of registration called an EMSID. The two voter history files
          were joined on voter EMSID. Therefore, the only voters included in this project are those that were in both voter history files.
          The 2018 file has 4,604,801 records and 3,667,662 (79.6%) matched with the 2013 file. According to the 2018 file, 2,706,535 
          people voted in the 2016 election. 106,085 (3.9%) of these voters were registered to vote prior to the 2008 
          presidential election, but did not vote until the 2016 presidential election.
          The records are geocoded to current election districts, not 2016 vintage districts. 
          Some of the election districts have been redrawn since 2016 
          and the election results for those districts are not available.
