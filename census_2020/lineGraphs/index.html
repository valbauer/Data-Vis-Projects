    <h1>Census 2020 Self-Response Rates</h1>
    <h4>For the 2020 census the Census Bureau sent mailings to nearly all households in the United States 
      providing the household residents with options for submitting their census responses. Households in 
      an "Internet First" area received a mailed invitation to respond online or by phone. Households in 
      "Internet Choice" areas received a mailed questionnaire as well as instructions on how to respond 
      online or by phone. Households in "Update/Leave" areas did not receive a mailed invitation. These
      are areas where people tend to receive mail at PO Boxes instead of a street address, or have been 
      impacted by recent natural disasters, or are otherwise rural who will receive a hand-delivered 
      census packet. Parts of Alaska will be counted in-person as part of the "Update/Enumerate or Remote Alaska"
      enumeration process  that started in January.
